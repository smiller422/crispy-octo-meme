# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

In the project I have created a word day calandar that will allow the user to input events at ceratin hours of the work day and save those events so they are still there when they reload the page. 
As time goes on, the hours will change colors indicating if the user is in the past, present or future timeblock. 
This project was fun to make and really helped me to understand for loops!
Thank you!
